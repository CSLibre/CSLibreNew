## What is **POP**?

**Procedural Oriented Programming** (**POP**) breaks programs into step-by-step **functions** or **procedures** that handle tasks in a sequence. **Data** moves freely between functions and can be accessed or changed globally. Languages like **C** and **BASIC** use this **top-down** approach, starting from the main task and breaking it into smaller parts.

## What is **OOP**?

**Object-Oriented Programming** (**OOP**) focuses on "**objects**" that bundle **data** and the **functions** working on it together, like real-world items such as a **car** with **color** (data) and **drive** (function). **Data** stays hidden inside objects and is safe from outside changes. Examples include **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**, using a **bottom-up** design by building small objects first.

## Key Differences Between POP and OOP

| Aspect | Procedural Oriented Programming (**POP**) | Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| Main Focus | Focuses on **functions** or procedures | Focuses on **objects** that combine data and methods|
| Data Handling | **Data flows freely** between functions | **Data is hidden** inside objects |
| Program Structure | Designed with a **top-down** approach | Designed with a **bottom-up** approach |
| Code Organization | Divides program into **functions** | Divides program into **objects** |
| Access to Data | Global access to data; can be modified by any function| Data accessed only through object's own functions |
| Reusability | Functions can be reused, but less flexible | Objects and classes promote easy reusability |
| Real-World Modeling| Less suited for real-world modeling | Models real-world entities as objects |
| Examples | **C**, **Pascal**, **BASIC** | **C++**, **Java**, **Python** |

While OOP builds apps like Instagram, functional programming runs behind Netflix's "Because you watched..." recommendations, and parallel programming is how Pixar renders movies like Toy Story frame by frame in weeks, not years! Different styles, real-world magic. 🎬✨
